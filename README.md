# Bike-Sharing Analysis
After a visit to New York City, my friend Kate was obessed with the idea of a bike sharing service and bringing one to Des Moines. Kate found a potential investor, and wants me to use Tableau Public to create a visual story with bike sharing data. Kate suggested we use Citi Bike data as its already been released to the public, but Citi Bike data is from New York City, not Des Moines. A good analysis of New York City data can still be a great first step in seeing what we might expect in Des Moines. Our visualizations are color based with the darker the color the more users. 

## Analysis Results:
The total number of trips by bike sharing service in August 2019 for New York City was 2,344,224. Now that is a lot of biking, which is why we want to apply this to Des Moines. This analysis will breakdown those numbers and show things like popular times and customer breakdowns. 
### Trips by Weekday

Our analysis has found that the most common times that the bikes are used is weekdays between 7am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm. Bikes are also pretty popular to use Fridays and Saturdays. Fridays being a little busier all around. Clearly many people use these to get to and from work. 
### Trips by Gender

When we breakdown the trips taken by gender, males take the most trips. Most of the prime biking times are the same, but when spilt to male, female, and unknown it does show that females bike the most on Saturdays. Most likely tourists or people taking lesiurely strolls. 
### Checkout Times

Checkout times for the bikes vary a lot. Lots of people use these bikes everyday for long periods of time.
### Checkout Times by Gender

When we break this analysis down by gender, we show that males (orange) take the most trips and the longest trips. Females (blue) take the second longest, and unknown (red) takes the least and shortest trips. 
### Customer or Subscriber

Citi Bike has two types of users, single pay customers and subscriber. Subscribers obviously are the main users, they out bike customers at almost every level. Getting subscribers should be a priority as we can get consistent people out almost everyday of the week showing our bikes to potential new customers or subscribers!
### Bike Utilization

This chart shows the bikes that are most commonly used. The bigger the circle the more use that bike gets. This is a great visualization to judge the amount of repairs that are needed. We can see which bikes need it the most and can switch those bikes out with lesser used ones while repairs are in progress. 
### Gender Breakdown

To the surprise of no one that has been looking at this data, males are the most likely to use bike sharing services. 

## In Conclusion
I believe that we can utilize this data to get us started here in Des Moines. I don't believe we should try to alienate any potential customer, but we need to start by targeting males since they are the most likely to use the service. Another visualization that we could run would be an age demographic, to see what age most males that use bike sharing are, and to help us cater ads towards that particular sub-group.  Once we have a core group of subscribers, business will be easy to build as we will get free advertising from the subscribers riding our bikes all around. A second visualization to run would be for the start and stop locations of the bikes, do they overlap and how often? We may even have to take that a step further and research those locations, are they downtown or rural? Are there tourist things near them? This data is only the beginning, and when we launch our own bike sharing service, we can gather even more specific data!
